Yet another try to get away from eprime.



task description
===========

30 cards, no pairs, 2 categories: faces and activity (reduces number of different classes of images which may harmonize connectivity patterns; the particular categories may also induce more connectivity, see paper XXXX).
Subjects come to the lab twice, once for learning with, once for learning without odor.

Control-Task			mit Geruch / eingermaßen ähnlich wie Task?
A resting state or kind of control task is conducted always before learning the actual task.

Learning			3 rounds (30 cards * 3 rounds * 5 s = 450 sec = 7.5 min)
Card presented on top of all others for 1 sec, then the same card is shown at the location that should be memorized. Subjects have 100 ms to look there and fixate the card for 5 sec. Then 2 sec break (to rest eyes etc.).  
The card is presented on top of all others, because thereby we a) elicit an association like in the old task, b) enable a good interference, c) does not require the subjects to learn the picture itself, d) makes learning more similar to the recall setup.
Fixation periods should not be too strict, it should not be a fixation task.
The order of cards should be always the same, but categories should be mixed randomly.

Immediate recall		3-4 rounds, depending on perf., last run w/o feedback (min. 7.5 min)
Card again presented on top; subject is required to look at the card where he/she thinks the card is located.

Odor-stimulation during sleep
10 sec odor on, 30 sec odor off for a minimum of 20 min; connectivity is measured for the whole odor-on time window and the last 10 sec of the odor-on time window.
